This project is just a quick contribution to the Internet to help my colleagues and other web enthusiasts who stumble upon this repo and would like to install Composer on a Linux web hosting 
account.

This repository contains a simple script to install Composer, a dependency manager for PHP, on Linux shared hosting accounts. This script is designed to streamline the installation process, making 
it easier for developers to manage their PHP dependencies.  

Features:
 - Easy installation of Composer on shared hosting environments.
 - Minimal dependencies required.
 - Simple command-line interface.

Requirements:
 - A Linux-based shared hosting account.
 - SSH access to your hosting account.
 - A modern and functionnal PHP environment (5.3+)


The installation is fairly simple:
Clone the repository
Make the script executable using chmod +x (I recommend using chmod 700)
Execute it using bash
